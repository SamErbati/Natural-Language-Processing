# Let's say we want to analyse the following text:
text = "Recent advancements in AI have led to remarkable improvements in natural language processing, enabling machines to understand and generate human-like text. Breakthroughs in deep learning and neural networks have also enhanced computer vision, allowing AI to outperform humans in tasks like image recognition and autonomous driving. Additionally, AI systems are increasingly being integrated into industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, transforming them with smarter decision-making and automation."

# Split the text into words
words = text.split()

# Remove Stopwords
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Add custom stopwords
custom_stopwords = {'','plot','characters','ending'}
stop_words.update(custom_stopwords)

# Filter out stopwords
filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]

# Join the filtered words back into a single string
filtered_text = ' '.join(filtered_words)

# Generate WorldCloud
