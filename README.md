# Natural-Language-Processing
In this repository, I'll introduce a few practical applications of NLP, and we will work with the NLTK library.

# Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): 
It's a powerful Python library used for working with human language data (text) and provides tools for text processing tasks like tokenization, parsing, classification, and semantic reasoning. It is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) research and applications for tasks like language modeling, text analysis, and machine learning.

# First Project is building a WordCloud: 
A word cloud visually represents the frequency of words in a given text, where the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance. This tool is often used for text analysis, allowing users to quickly identify the most common or significant words in a document, dataset, or corpus. The WordCloud library allows customization of fonts, shapes, and colors for aesthetic flexibility.
